# Vacancy Dashboard

This is a simple personal pet project - a vacancy dashboard built with Vue 3. It allows me to manage and filter job vacancies scraped from external sources.

## ✨ Features
### 📄 Displays a list of job vacancies

### ✅ Manage vacancy status (e.g., mark as banned, interesting, etc.)

### 🔍 Filter vacancies by status

### ❌ Add stop words for title and description to auto-ban irrelevant listings

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend

## 🧠 Why I Built This
My main goal was to deploy a full-stack app to Vercel using Edge Functions.
I wanted a simple project to explore edge-first architecture while building something useful for myself - a dashboard to track and manage job vacancies.
